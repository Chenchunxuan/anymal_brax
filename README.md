# ANYmal BRAX
This repository contains code and files to train ANYmal robot in simulation using RL. 
Besides the raw training code, convenience functions are provided for logging training progress in BRAX. 
To benefit from the gradients provided by the fully differentiable simulation, applications of APG are explored.

**DISCLAIMER: This code is not official research code, but was instead developed as part of a course project at ETH. No guarantees for its completeness or correctness can be given.**

The given code is made publicly available for the benefit of the robotics/simulation communities, to have a trainable model of a real legged robot.
